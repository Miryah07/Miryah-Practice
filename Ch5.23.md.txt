/* (Demonstrate cancellation errors). A cancellation
 
error occurs when you are manipulating a very large 
 
number with a very small number. The large number
 
may cancel out the small number. For example, the 
 
result of 100000000.0 + 0.000000001 is equal to
 
100000000.0. To avoid cancellation errors and obtain
 
more accurate results, carefully select the order

of computation. For example, in computing the
 
following summation, you will obtain more 
 
accurate results by computing from right 
to
 left rather than from left to right:
 
1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + .... + 1/n
